# Simple-To-Do-App

Hi, this is a Simple To Do App I built with [electron][2] ([electron-forge][1] template). 

To Run Code:

Make sure you have Node.js, npm and yarn (recommended, but not required) installed. 

Download this repo and unzip the folder. cd into the folder. Then, run the below 
commands:

```
yarn install (or npm install if using npm, yarn recommended because of yarn.lock)
npm start (or yarn start, either one works)
```
